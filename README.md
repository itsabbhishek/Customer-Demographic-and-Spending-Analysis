# Demographic and Spending Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction:

In this project, I developed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to analyze demographic data and spending patterns. The dashboard provides insights into customer demographics, income utilization, and spending behavior, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for targeted marketing strategies and product development.

## Objectives:

1. **Demographic Analysis:** Analyze customer demographics such as age group, gender, occupation, and city-wise distributions.
2. **Income Utilization Analysis:** Calculate average income utilization percentage and identify spending patterns by income group.
3. **Spending Insights:** Determine where customers spend the most and analyze spending behavior based on demographics and other factors.
4. **Dashboard Development:** Create interactive and visually appealing dashboards in Power BI to present key insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Data Collection and Preparation:

The raw data for this analysis was obtained from [source]. It includes demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, income, and spending details. The data was cleaned and processed using Python and SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency.
